# Seahawk Restaurant Management System

The Seahawk Restaurant Management System is designed to address the challenges of improper meat inventory management and enhance the customer experience through a sophisticated reservation system. This project includes two main modules: a **Smart Inventory Module** and a **Smart Reservation Module**.

## Features

### Smart Inventory Module
- **Expiration Tracking**: Monitors expiration dates of meat inventories (beef, pork, and chicken) and notifies inventory staff before items expire.
- **Market Price Monitoring**: Tracks current market prices for high-quality meats and alerts staff when prices drop below the 5-day moving average for timely ordering.
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Notifies staff when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predicts potential meat shortages based on historical purchase data, providing proactive notifications.
- **Detailed Inventory Data**: Allows inventory staff to view comprehensive inventory information.

### Smart Reservation Module
- **Seating Capacity**: Manages a seating capacity of 300, with the option to expand to 400 seats.
- **Reservation Management**: Customers can reserve up to 200 seats in a single reservation.
- **Visual Seating Layout**: Displays real-time status of each table (reserved, occupied, available) for easy management.
- **Reservation Modifications**: Customers can make, update, or cancel reservations.
- **Automatic Cancellation**: Reservations are automatically canceled if customers do not arrive within 30 minutes of the scheduled time.
- **Special Accommodations**: Customers can request specific needs (e.g., wheelchair accessibility) and save seating preferences for future bookings.
- **Estimated Wait Times**: Provides estimated wait times for walk-in customers.

## Requirements

```

### 3. Install dependencies (DO NOT TOUCH DB YET)

Install the required Python packages:
